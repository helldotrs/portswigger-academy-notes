variable types:
    let/var/const 
        var is original type. best to use let instead.

main data types: 
    num/string/bool
        is int called num in js???

is there any valid usecase for == instead of ===??
or ** instead of **=

funcitons:
    if they look like right
        function my_fun(a, b){
    it is es5

    if they look ridicolus
        const my_fun = (a, b) => {
    it is es6 (most popular js version)
    I mean I can see merit to saving a funciton in a const but.... it looks konstigt (pun intended)   

square brackets [] for array

loops:
    while
    for         // legacy style: for(i = 0; i >= 10; i++){
    do...while  // damn thats a dumb name

DOM
    Most of what the DOM does is change, replace, edit, or in some form, manipulate the HTML file or webpage that you're working on
    The Document Object Model
    <button onclick="my_fun()">click here</button> //html is such dinosour.
